# Sorter

## Overview

This project consists of two main modules:

1. **Random Text File Generator**: Generates a text file of a specified size with random content.
2. **Sorter**: Sorts a large text file using an efficient k-way merge algorithm. The sorting process involves splitting the file into manageable chunks, sorting these chunks in parallel, and then merging them back into a single sorted file.
